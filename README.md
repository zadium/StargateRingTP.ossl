# Stargate teleporter ring [StargateRingTP]

Idea is based on idea "APN Ring Transporters (OSGrid/OpenSim) by Spectre Draconia and author: Warin Cascabel, April 2009"

I rebuilt it from scratch the code also i am working on mesh too.

the gate rez a ring, sent message to it contain key of avi, each ring listen to channel, will teleport an avi by that key
